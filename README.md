Title - BCCD for ARM Devices primarily 'Raspberry Pii'

Introduction
BCCD (Bootable Cluster CD) was created to facilitate instruction of parallel computing aspects and paradigms. It was originally developed by Earlham College and SHODOR Foundation.

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny and affordable computer that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects. It is available for $35, thus makes it very easily accessible.

Goal
The goal of this project is to use the current BCCD operating system and run it on Raspberry Pii devices, so students can learn the hardware-software conceps of it.
