<H1> BCCD for ARM Devices primarily 'Raspberry Pii' </H1>

BCCD (Bootable Cluster CD) was created to facilitate instruction of parallel computing aspects and paradigms. It was originally developed by Earlham College and SHODOR Foundation.

The Raspberry Pi is a tiny and affordable computer that you can use to learn programming through fun, practical projects. It is available for $35, thus makes it very easily accessible.

<H2> Objectives </H2>

The goal of this project is to use the current BCCD operating system and run it on Raspberry Pii devices, so students can learn the hardware-software conceps of it.
