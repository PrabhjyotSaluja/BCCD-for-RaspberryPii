Step by step explanation:

1. We are using PiLFS(Linux from Scratch on the Raspberry Pii), the primary target device is Raspberry Pii-3 because it has much faster processing power.

This the basic kernel image that I can be downloaded from this link -  http://circu.it/pilfs/pilfs-base-rpi3-20160622.img.xz
A copy of this image is available on this repository also.

Steps:
1. Download the Image (http://circu.it/pilfs/pilfs-base-rpi3-20160622.img.xz) and use RUFUS(Free download on Windows) to make a bootable microSD card.

2. Mount the card to the device and boot it up, the default user name is root and the password is "pilfs"
	a. If you do a $ df -h (Shows you the disk space in Human Readable format, it might show more than 98% disk is used, and can't be utilized)
	b. Now, we need to liberate the system aftet that you can use the free storage available.
		Follow these instructions:
Resizing Your ext4 Partition

I. Start fdisk and press 'p' to print the partition table:
$ fdisk /dev/mmcblk0
II. Note the Start sector (98304 on the PiLFS Base image) of the Linux partition.
> Now press 'd' and '2' to delete it.
> Then press 'n', 'p', '2', the Start sector, 'enter' and 'w'.
This re-creates the ext4 partition with the maximum size available.

Finally, reboot your Pi, then perform the actual resize:

III. resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2

3. After you're logged in, the baby steps are completed now the major thing starts. 
	Now we'll install the different linux packages.
	Note: This image does not have the sudo package installed so it needs to be manually installed and configured. You might have to tweak build scripts to make perfect install.
