Step by step explanation:

1. We are using PiLFS(Linux from Scratch on the Raspberry Pii), the primary target device is Raspberry Pii-3 because it has much faster processing power.

This the basic kernel image that I can be downloaded from this link -  http://circu.it/pilfs/pilfs-base-rpi3-20160622.img.xz
A copy of this image is available on this repository also.

Steps:
1. Download the Image (http://circu.it/pilfs/pilfs-base-rpi3-20160622.img.xz) and use RUFUS(Free download on Windows) to make a bootable microSD card.

2. Mount the card to the device and boot it up, the default user name is root and the password is "pilfs"

3. After you're logged in, the baby steps are completed now the major thing starts. 
	Now we'll install the different linux packages.
	Note: This image does not have the sudo package installed so it needs to be manually installed and configured. You might have to tweak build scripts to make perfect install.
